The Florida Keys are rich in maritime history, but if these heritage resources and sites are not marked and explained to the public, itâ€™s not accessible as a public resource. Thus, total number of maritime heritage and archaeological resource sites that have been interpreted for public outreach is used in this report as an indicator of maritime heritage condition, and has been increasing since the designation of the Sanctuary, with a noted increase since 2014.
