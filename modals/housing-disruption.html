Housing disruption was selected as an indicator of available ecosystem services, as a measure of social vulnerability in a
vacation destination area with high amounts of second home ownership and low availability of rentable long term housing,
both relating to high levels of tourism and gentrification. Additionally, housing disruption occurs due to hurricanes and
storms. The Florida Keys have a high level of housing disruption in all regions/municipalities, except for northern Key Largo.
