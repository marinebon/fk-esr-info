Not only do mangroves provide ecosystem services in the form of coastal protection, but they are also an important nursery
habitat for juvenile fish, invertebrate and other marine species, as well as important seabird roosting habitat. This habitat
indicator has experienced a net loss in land cover over the past 20 years. Source: <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional.html">NOAA National Ocean Service satellite information and Office for Coastal Management C-CAP program</a>.
