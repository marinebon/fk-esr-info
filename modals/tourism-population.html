Though experts agreed that tourism visitation was an important indicator, data on this metric was surprisingly hard to
come by, due to the need to capture all types of overnight visitors, day trip visitors, both in state and out of state visitors,
and international as well as domestic visitors. Additionally, each municipality has a different method of recording number
of visitors. Thus, this study was recommended to review trends in the tourist tax revenue collected as a proxy to capture the longest time series trends in all categories of
visitors. Data was adjusted to reflect changes through time in the percentage of tax levied. Of note is a recent decrease occurred in 2017 due to Hurricane Irma making
landfall in the Lower Keys.
