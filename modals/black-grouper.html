Black grouper were selected as a key indicator for the condition of living resources in the Florida Keys, due to their status as a targeted species by recreational and commercial fishers. The status and trend in this species were represented by calculating the average abundance per species per fishery independent dive survey, per monitored reef site in the Florida Keys.The abundance of black grouper dropped from the early 2000s to 2014 and on, though the trend has remained stable over the past five years.
